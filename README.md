## üöÄ Features

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Users select their role (user/admin) at registration. Roles are securely stored in Firestore and used for all routing and UI decisions.
- **Admin-Only Features**: Admin panel, ticket assignment, and management are only accessible to admins. Admins are redirected away from user-only pages.
- **User-Only Features**: Users can only access their own dashboard and tickets. Admin links and features are hidden for non-admins.
- **Protected Routing**: All admin routes are protected by a reusable `AdminRoute` component. User pages also guard against admin access.
- **Loading Spinners**: Protected routes show a loading spinner while authentication and role are being determined.
- **Automated Tests**: Role-based routing and UI are covered by automated tests.

### 1. **Authentication**
- **Email/Password Sign Up & Login**
- **Google Sign-In** (OAuth)
- **Role-based Routing**: Users and admins are redirected to their respective dashboards after login.
- **Logout**: Securely ends the session.

### 2. **User Dashboard**

- **Premium Ticket Option**:  
  - Checkbox to ‚ÄúMark as Premium (‚Çπ49)‚Äù
  - If checked, triggers Razorpay payment.
  - On success, stores `paymentId` and marks ticket as `isPremium: true`.
- **Real-Time Submission**: Ticket appears instantly in your dashboard and ‚ÄúMy Tickets‚Äù.

### 4. **My Tickets**
- **Live List**: See all your tickets, updated in real time.
- **Status & Priority Badges**: Color-coded for clarity.
- **Attachment Links**: Download/view uploaded files.

### 5. **Admin Panel**

  - Assign to agent/user (with live user search)
  - Change status (Open, In Progress, Resolved)

- **Role-Based Access**: Only admins can access this panel and perform admin actions.

### 6. **Razorpay Integration**
- **Premium Ticket Payment**:  
  - Secure Razorpay checkout for premium support.
  - Test key used for development (no KYC required).
  - Payment ID stored with ticket for audit.

### 7. **Firebase Integration**
- **Authentication**: Secure, real-time user management.
- **Firestore**:  
  - Tickets and users stored in collections.
  - Real-time listeners for instant UI updates.
- **Storage**: File uploads for ticket attachments.
- **Role Management**: User roles (user/admin) stored in Firestore and used for routing and access control.

### 8. **Security & Best Practices**
- **Environment Variables**: All sensitive config (Firebase, Razorpay) loaded from `.env` (never pushed to git).
- **.gitignore**: Ensures secrets and local files are never committed.
- **Production-Ready**: Linter warnings/errors fixed, code organized, and ready for deployment.

## üõ°Ô∏è Role-Based Access Control

TickSwift implements robust, secure role-based access control for users and admins:

- **Role Selection at Registration**: Users choose their role (user or admin) when registering. This role is stored in Firestore under their UID.
- **Role Fetched on Login**: After login, the app fetches the user's role from Firestore and stores it in global context.
- **Role-Based Routing**: 
  - Admins are automatically redirected to the admin panel (`/admin`).
  - Users are redirected to their dashboard (`/dashboard`).
  - Admins are prevented from accessing user-only pages (dashboard, tickets, etc.) and are always redirected to `/admin`.
- **AdminRoute Protection**: All admin-only routes are wrapped in a reusable `AdminRoute` component that checks authentication and role.
- **UI Controls**: Admin links and features are only visible to admins. Users never see admin options.
- **Loading Spinners**: Protected routes show a loading spinner while authentication and role are being determined, ensuring a smooth experience.
- **Automated Tests**: The codebase includes automated tests to verify that role-based routing and UI behave as expected for both users and admins.

## ‚ö° Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tickswift.git
   cd tickswift
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root:
     ```
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_key
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
     ```
   - (Optional) Add your Razorpay key if you switch from the public test key.

4. **Start the app**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## üîí Security Notes

- **Never commit your `.env` file** (it‚Äôs in `.gitignore`).
- For production, update your Firestore security rules to restrict access by user and role.
- Use your own Razorpay live key for real payments (after KYC).

## üì¶ Deployment

- Deploy the `build/` folder to Vercel, Netlify, Firebase Hosting, or your preferred static host.
- Set environment variables in your hosting dashboard.
